                  Coursera was founded by Daphne Koller and Andrew Ng in 2012 with a vision of providing life-transforming learning experiences to learners around the world. Today, Coursera is a global online learning platform that offers anyone, anywhere, access to online courses and degrees from leading universities and companies. Coursera received B Corp certification in February 2021, which means that we have a legal duty not only to our shareholders, but to also make a positive impact on society more broadly, as we continue our efforts to reduce barriers to world-class education for all.
